**Reflecting on Software Engineering**

Although ICS 314 is taught using web application development tools, the course ultimately taught me broader software engineering principles that apply far beyond building websites. Over the semester, I learned that software engineering is not just about writing code, but about managing complexity, collaborating effectively, and building systems that can evolve over time. Three concepts that stood out to me were **Agile Project Management**, **Configuration Management**, and **Coding Standards**.

One of the most important ideas I learned was **Agile Project Management**, which is an approach to software development that emphasizes short development cycles, frequent feedback, and adaptability to change. Instead of planning everything upfront, Agile focuses on making small, incremental improvements and adjusting as new information becomes available. In ICS 314, we used a specific form of Agile called **Issue Driven Project Management**, where work is organized into small, well-defined issues that are assigned to individuals and completed within a short time frame. I can easily see myself using this approach outside of web development, such as in research projects, robotics, or data analysis pipelines. Breaking work into issues, tracking progress visibly, and integrating changes frequently helps reduce confusion and prevents large problems from building up unnoticed.

Another key concept was **Configuration Management**, which refers to the practice of controlling and tracking changes to software over time. This includes using version control systems like Git, managing branches, handling merges, and ensuring that everyone on a team is working with consistent configurations. Before this class, I viewed version control mainly as a way to save code, but ICS 314 showed me that configuration management is essential for collaboration and reliability. These ideas apply to any project involving shared resources, whether it is software, documentation, or even datasets, because they help teams coordinate work without overwriting or losing progress.

Finally, I learned the importance of **Coding Standards**, which are shared rules about how code should be written and structured. Coding standards improve readability, maintainability, and teamwork by ensuring that everyone’s code follows the same conventions. In this course, tools like ESLint enforced these standards automatically. While this sometimes felt restrictive, it ultimately helped me write clearer and more consistent code. This concept extends beyond web development, since any long-term software project benefits from consistency and clarity, especially as teams grow or change.

Overall, ICS 314 helped me understand that software engineering is about processes, discipline, and collaboration just as much as it is about programming. The concepts I learned—Agile project management, configuration management, and coding standards—are applicable to many different technical fields and will influence how I approach future projects well beyond web application development.
