Beginning my journey with TypeScript has been both exciting and challenging. I have not taken any ICS courses recently due to scheduling conflicts and general education requirements, so returning to coding feels like starting fresh. Since I haven’t been practicing or refreshing my programming knowledge, picking up TypeScript has required some extra effort and adjustment.

TypeScript, as an extension of JavaScript, introduces static typing, which has felt somewhat unfamiliar compared to the languages I have used in the past. Writing with types still feels a little awkward at times, but I recognize the benefits. From my perspective, TypeScript is an excellent language because its static typing makes programs easier to understand and debug. One of its greatest strengths is catching bugs early in the development process, before they become buried inside multiple layers of functions and harder to fix later on.

The “workouts of the day” assignments we have been doing are particularly engaging. They present a lot to take in and force me to think critically about how to approach each problem. I appreciate that the course encourages the use of AI tools, as they provide timely guidance when I need it most. I have not completed many of the practice WODs outside of class, but even the practice one we did together was challenging in a way that pushed me to problem-solve actively instead of relying on a pre-made solution. This hands-on, task-focused learning feels much more effective than passively listening to lectures, because I am constantly practicing and applying concepts with a clear purpose.

That said, I also find the co-op WODs stressful at times. Occasionally I blank out and cannot immediately recall the syntax or structure I need, so I have to ask for help or look things up. While this can be frustrating, I know it reflects real-world software engineering challenges. In the end, this course is preparing me for what I may encounter in the industry, and the discipline and active learning it requires are valuable steps in building strong software engineering skills.
