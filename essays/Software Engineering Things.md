## **My favorite things about software engineering**

The first thing I love about software engineering is the power to build anything from scratch—the screen is my canvas, and I get to turn ideas into reality. When I’m working on a project, I’m motivated by the creative freedom to design both how something works and how it looks. A single problem can be approached in countless different ways, and I enjoy having the autonomy to decide what I build and how I build it. The artistry of software engineering never ceases to inspire me.

As I’ve grown as a developer, I’ve realized that creating software is about more than just writing code—it’s about building connections, both virtually and personally. Networking technology is what truly brings software to life, allowing applications to talk to each other and people to interact across continents. When I set up a web app or contribute to a distributed project, I’m not just writing functions or fixing bugs; I’m enabling communication, breaking down barriers, and sometimes creating communities that would never exist otherwise.

Another thing I like about software engineering is that there’s always something new to learn. The industry evolves rapidly, especially with advances in networking and cloud infrastructure. Whether it’s exploring new protocols, scaling systems for thousands of users, or experimenting with generative AI as part of a larger distributed service, there’s always a fresh challenge waiting. Learning how APIs work, optimizing data transmission, or securing information in transit has made me appreciate just how essential networking is to modern software.

The aspect I enjoy the most is seeing my work actually make a difference for others. The feeling that people are using something I helped build, whether it’s a club website, a multiplayer game, or a reliable messaging tool, is incredibly rewarding. Knowing that my code keeps people connected securely or helps communities collaborate instantly motivates me to go further.

## **Skills I want to develop, experiences I want to acquire**

Going forward, I want to deepen my skills in network architecture and cybersecurity so I can build more resilient applications. I hope to work on projects that require designing fault-tolerant systems, securing data exchanges, and scaling services to support thousands, if not millions of users. I’m eager to experience working in a professional development environment where my software not only solves problems, but fosters global connections.

Ultimately, my goal as a software engineer is not just to create things, but to help people communicate, share, and thrive through technology—one connection at a time.
