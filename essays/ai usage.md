## **I. Introduction**

The use of AI in education, especially in software engineering, presents both opportunities and challenges. AI tools can greatly support learning by speeding up development, explaining concepts, and assisting with debugging. However, overreliance on AI can limit a student’s ability to fully understand underlying concepts. In a course like ICS 314, where time pressure and correctness are emphasized, the temptation to use AI for quick solutions is high. Throughout this course, I primarily used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to assist with coding and problem-solving.

## **II. Personal Experience with AI**

### **1\. Experience WODs (e.g., E18)**

For experience WODs, I usually attempted the problem on my own first. If I ran out of time or got stuck, I would watch the solution video and then redo the WOD. Over time, I started using ChatGPT to help speed up the process, especially when I already understood the general idea but needed help implementing the solution efficiently.

### **2\. In-class Practice WODs**

I used AI sparingly during in-class practice WODs. Since these were not graded strictly on correctness, I focused more on understanding patterns and practicing the workflow rather than producing perfect solutions. AI was mainly used for quick clarification or syntax checks.

### **3\. In-class WODs**

I relied on AI more heavily during in-class WODs due to the time constraints and grading pressure. My main goal was to avoid receiving very low scores, even if the solution was not perfect. That said, for WODs that closely resembled practice problems, I was often able to complete them without AI by recognizing familiar patterns.

### **4\. Essays**

For essays, I primarily used AI for grammar checks, clarity improvements, and reorganizing my ideas. The content and opinions were my own, but AI helped refine the presentation.

### **5\. Final Project**

The final project involved significant AI assistance. I frequently pasted relevant sections of code into ChatGPT and described the behavior I wanted to achieve. This approach sometimes felt like “vibe coding,” where I focused on results first and then dealt with bugs afterward. When issues arose, I used AI to help diagnose and fix errors.

### **6\. Learning a Concept or Tutorial**

I typically did not rely on AI when learning entirely new concepts. Instead, I preferred reading documentation, tutorials, or other online resources to build foundational understanding before applying AI assistance.

### **7\. Answering Questions in Class or Discord**

I did not use AI for answering questions in class or on Discord, largely because I did not frequently respond to questions in those settings.

### **8\. Asking or Answering Smart Questions**

I did not use AI for this purpose, as I rarely needed to ask questions publicly during the course.

### **9\. Coding Examples**

When learning new functions or libraries (such as during functional programming), I often searched online and reviewed examples provided by search engines, including AI-generated examples. This helped clarify usage patterns quickly.

### **10\. Explaining Code**

I generally did not use AI to explain code, as I preferred reading documentation or tracing the code myself to understand how it worked.

### **11\. Writing Code**

AI was used extensively when writing code, especially for generating boilerplate, suggesting patterns, or handling repetitive tasks.

### **12\. Documenting Code**

I did not use AI for documenting code, as documentation was not a major focus in this course.

### **13\. Quality Assurance and Debugging**

I frequently used ChatGPT when encountering errors, ESLint warnings, or unexpected behavior. AI was particularly helpful for interpreting error messages and suggesting possible fixes.

## **III. Impact on Learning and Understanding**

AI was most beneficial when used as a learning aid rather than a shortcut. Asking AI to explain why a solution worked or why an error occurred helped deepen my understanding. However, when I relied on AI too quickly, I sometimes missed opportunities to struggle productively and learn more deeply.

## **IV. Practical Applications**

Outside of this course, I have used AI for technical projects involving debugging, scripting, and researching unfamiliar technologies. These experiences reinforced the idea that AI is most effective when paired with a solid understanding of fundamentals.

## **V. Challenges and Opportunities**

The biggest challenge with AI is the risk of dependency. I personally fell into this trap at times during the course. A major opportunity lies in teaching students how to ask better questions and use AI as a learning companion rather than an answer generator.

## **VI. Comparative Analysis**

AI-enhanced learning can be more effective than traditional methods, but only when used responsibly. Students who use AI to explore concepts and reflect on solutions benefit more than those who use it solely to produce answers.

## **VII. Future Considerations**

AI in software engineering education is inevitable. The key challenge moving forward will be guiding students toward using AI to support learning rather than replace it. Instruction on effective prompting and responsible AI use would be beneficial.

## **VIII. Conclusion**

AI can significantly enhance learning in software engineering when used correctly. However, the structure of courses like ICS 314 can unintentionally encourage students to prioritize correctness over understanding due to grading pressure and time constraints. As a result, students may turn to AI to protect their grades rather than to learn. With better guidance and incentives, AI could become a powerful tool for deeper learning rather than a shortcut.
