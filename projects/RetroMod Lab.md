### **RetroMod Lab**

**Console Modding and Homebrew Exploration**

I had always been curious about how older gaming consoles could be repurposed beyond their original limits. Over time, I collected a few aging systems: a Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Nintendo 3DS. Instead of letting them sit unused, I decided to build a small “RetroMod Lab,” where I could learn about custom firmware, homebrew applications, and system-level software modification. My goal was not just to play retro games, but to understand how these devices boot, how security exploits work, and how to safely apply mods without bricking the hardware.

### **Setup & Experimentation**

I started with the Nintendo Wii, installing the Homebrew Channel after learning how save file exploits worked. From there, I experimented with running emulators and utilities, which gave me insight into how the Wii’s operating system handled unsigned code.

On the Xbox 360 and PS3, I explored custom firmware (CFW) installations. This taught me about NAND/NOR flashing, differences between hardware revisions, and why certain models are easier to mod than others. I carefully followed documentation to patch firmware images and load them without corrupting the system.

For handhelds like the 3DS and PS Vita, I worked with modern exploits that allowed me to run homebrew apps and even customize themes. Installing these required understanding of encryption keys, QR-based exploits, and community tools.

While much of this involved following community guides, the deeper I got, the more I learned about how closed systems enforce security and how developers work around those protections for legitimate homebrew development.

### **Experience Gained**

* **System Software**: Learned about firmware updates, bootloaders, and how exploits target flaws in them.

* **Hardware Awareness**: Understood differences in console hardware revisions and why some models are more “open” to modification.

* **Security Concepts**: Saw firsthand how encryption, digital signatures, and sandboxing protect devices — and how exploits bypass them.

* **Homebrew Development**: Ran and tested open-source software created by communities, gaining appreciation for reverse engineering.

* **Troubleshooting & Risk Management**: Practiced careful reading of technical documentation to avoid bricking consoles.

### **Next Steps**

I want to extend this project by experimenting with building a small homebrew app myself, even something simple like a utility for file management. I also plan to document the differences across each console in terms of security and ease of modification, almost like a comparative study. While these devices are “legacy” in 2025, the skills I’ve gained transfer directly into cybersecurity, system administration, and embedded development.
